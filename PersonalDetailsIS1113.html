	<h2> About Me: </h2>
	<p> Currently a first year BIS student at University College Cork. A level-headed, hard-working and energetic young web-developer. I consider myself thorough and precise in everything that I engage in and have a keen interest in technology, web/mobile applications and understand the importance of the user experience. My first engagement with computer coding languages was through Visual Basic in which I gained a vast knowledge of the process and problem solving qualities in relation to User Interface development and design. <br> This project has taught me invaluable lessons in relation to the Hypertext Markup Language that is html, and web devlopment design in general. I understand one of the more pragmatic factors of web design is the user experience. Our job as Web Developers is to make use of innovative design techniques to save time and make users' lives a lot easier. Based from my relevant studies and project work to-date I have a proven ability in User Interface design and functionality to meet both end users and the environnement in which they are required to be employed. I have earned upper second class honours(2:1) in first semester exams and sustain a solid track record to-date in Information Technology and Web Development. </p>
