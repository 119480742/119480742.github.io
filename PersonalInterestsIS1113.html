<h2>Hurling</h2>
<hr>
<p>Sport plays an extremely important role in my life as a student and an athlete. Hurling was my first love and I've been involved with my club since I was four years old. I have played with Glen Rovers from the acadamey and street leagues all the way to senior where I hope to continue playing at well into my thirties. Through the years i have been involved in many presitgious competitions,  winning a couple along the way. We reached the u14 county final but lost unfortunately. Two motnhs later we were invited to attend a Munster Feile competition and ended the day by winning the final. We had a shot at redemption in the u15 County final and fprtunately we won in a great game versus Douglas. Back to u16 and I was awarded the captaincy for the year which I carried until minor. We were knocked out of the u16 championship in the semi-final stage but a couple of us u16 were still gifted the oppurtunity to play in the minor championship. We reached the county final and were underdgos against a talented Midleton side. We ran out winners and I was awarded evening echos man of the match award which i was utterly thrilled about. The following year I was asked to represnt Cork at Inter-county level for the minor team. I worked hard to come back from a shoulder injury and was picked to start in the first game. Unfortunately our season ended prematurely as we never progressed past the group stages but it was a huge honour none the less</p>

<h2>Golf</h2>
<hr>
<p>Believe it or not it was through hurling in which i became a member of Fota Island Golf cLub. I had built up an interest in golf from my youth as we had a family home every easter in the Castlerosse hotel in Killarney, adjacent to the former host to the Irish Open Killarney Golf and Fishing club. I became a member when i was 16 years old and took a liking to it almost immeditaly. Through the summer I spent plenty of time during the day playing golf with a couple of other juveniles and made great friend through this. I was asked to represent the junior golf team so I took the oppurtunity with both hands. I entered my first competition and ended up winning with a stableford score of 49 points, the highest stableford score recorded at Cobh Golf CLub. After this I played in Fred Daly matches and reached the Irish Foursomes Matchplay semi-final, losing unfortunately. Golf for me was second priority and more catered to enjoyment than serious sport.</p>
